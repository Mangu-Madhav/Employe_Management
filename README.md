# Employe_Management
This project is a simple Employee Management System built using Spring Boot in Spring Tool Suite (STS). It demonstrates how to build a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application using:

Spring Web for building RESTful APIs

Spring Data JPA for ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

H2 Database for in-memory data storage during development and testing

The application exposes a set of RESTful endpoints to manage employee data, including adding new employees, updating existing ones, viewing all employees, viewing a specific employee by ID, and deleting an employee.
